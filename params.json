{"name":"Pequod","tagline":"Participatory Planning Procedure Prototype","body":"This agent-based Netlogo model is a feasibility study for an aspect of participatory economics, which requires participatory economic planning in iterations between councils composed of workers and councils composed of consumers. These councils are the agents of the system.\r\n\r\nThis model is based upon the work of Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert on participatory economics. Along with Robin Hahnel, the researchers developing the model's conceptual and computational aspects are Michael Weisdorf, Christan Echt, and Nick Gilla.\r\n\r\nThe model can be shared and modified under the terms of the GPL version 3. The code can be downloaded from and changes submitted to its [Github repository](https://github.com/ParticipatoryEconomics/pequod).\r\n\r\n[ParticipatoryEconomics.info](http://participatoryeconomics.info) provides free e-books and other informational materials on participatory economics.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
